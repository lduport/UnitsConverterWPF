# UnitsConverterWPF
A small unit of measure converted WPF application using Prism, mahApps, ReactiveUI...

The application has been designed to support the following features:

- Perform a simple conversion
- Reverse conversion settings
- Copy of the result to the clipboard
- Display an history of the last conversions
- Conversion in several units simultaneously -- NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Display of the formula used (like Google) -- NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Converting a file -- NOT IMPLEMENTED

Because this is a sample application, the solution contains only one project with the following structure
